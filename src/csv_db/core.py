class CsvDB(object):
    """A class for interfacing with a simple database backed by a csv file.

    A `CsvDB` instance is initialised with a file path that defines a csv file, either
    an existing file or one that doesn't yet exist. In the case where the file exists, the
    file will be used as the underlying database file where records are recorded and
    retrieved. In this case, it is assumed that the first row of the csv file contains the
    field names of the database and these are checked against the fields supplied during
    initialisation.

    If the csv file doesn't exist at the supplied path, then it will be created when
    adding the first record to the database via the `create()` method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str or os.PathLike
        The file path to a csv file.
    fields : Collection[str]
        A collection of field names to be used for the database. This should not contain
        repeated field names or the empty string. If the csv file at `path` exists, then
        `fields` should match the fields defined as the header row in the file.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the supplied `fields` is empty, contains empty strings or contains repeated
        strings.
    MissingFieldsError
        If the csv database file at `path` contains empty field names.
    RepeatedFieldsError
        If the csv database file at `path` contains repeated field names in its first row.
    FieldsMismatchError
        If the supplied `fields` does not define the same set of field names as present
        in the csv file at `path`.
